<div><h2>Tests</h2></div>
<ol>
<li>Single-variant tests: This is a type of statistical test that analyzes the association between a genetic variant and a phenotype of interest by testing each variant individually. A common example of a single-variant test is the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) association test, which compares the frequency of a specific SNP between individuals with and without a certain trait.</li>
</ol>
<div>	</div>
<div>	An example of a single-variant test would be a case-control study that examines the association between a specific SNP (rs12345) and the risk of developing a certain type of cancer. Researchers would <b>compare the frequency of the SNP among individuals with cancer (cases) and individuals without cancer </b>(controls) to see if there is an association between the SNP and the disease.</div>
<div><br></div>
<ol>
<li>Gene-based burden test (mean): This is a type of statistical test that evaluates the overall effect of multiple genetic variants within a gene on a phenotype of interest. The test compares the mean number of variants between cases and controls, or alternatively the number of cases with a certain number of variants or more. The test does not take into account the correlation among variants, also it's based on the assumption that every variant in a gene is contributing to the phenotype in the same direction.</li>
</ol>
<div><br></div>
<div>	An example of a gene-based burden test (mean) would be a case-control study that examines the association between the number of deleterious variants within a gene (e.g BRCA1) and the risk of breast cancer. Researchers would <b>calculate the mean number of deleterious variants among individuals with breast cancer (cases) and individuals without breast cancer (controls) </b>and perform a statistical test to see if there is an association between the number of variants and the disease.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div><br></div>
<ol>
<li>SKAT (Sequence Kernel Association Test): is a gene-based test that utilizes information from all variants within a gene, including rare and common variants. It uses a kernel-based approach that weights variants based on their functional effect and allele frequency. It allows to detect association signal from variants that have small effects individually but together have a large impact on phenotype.</li>
</ol>
<div><br></div>
<div>An example of SKAT, would be a case-control study that examines the association between variants in the gene APOE, which is known to be associated with Alzheimer's disease. Researchers would use the Sequence Kernel Association Test (SKAT) to analyze the effect of all the variants within the gene on the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, taking into account their functional effect and allele frequency.</div>
<div><br></div>
<ol>
<li>SKAT-O (Optimal SKAT): This is a variant of the SKAT test that takes into account the correlation among variants within a gene, by using a optimal weight function for variants, it aims to improve power for detecting association of rare variants.</li>
</ol>
<div><br></div>
<div>An example of SKAT-O, would be a case-control study that examines the association between rare variants in the gene PCSK9, which is known to be associated with hypercholesterolemia. Researchers would use the optimal SKAT (SKAT-O) to analyze the effect of all the rare variants within the gene on the risk of developing hypercholesterolemia, by taking into account the correlation among variants within the gene.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Overall, these tests are useful for identifying genetic variants that are associated with a specific phenotype, such as a disease. By analyzing multiple variants within a gene or group of genes, they can help to detect association signal that might be missed by single-variant tests.</div>
<div>As for documentation, the best source would be the original papers where the methods were described, you can find it by searching the name of the method in scientific databases such as PubMed or Google Scholar. Also, the R package documentation could be helpful too.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>It's important to note that these are just examples and in practice, a study would need to consider multiple factors such as sample size, power, and multiple testing correction in the statistical analysis. Also, it's worth noting that association studies can only suggest association but not causation.</div>

<div><h2><br></h2></div>
<div><h2><br></h2></div>
<div><h2>Variant types</h2></div>
<div><h2><br></h2></div>
<ol>
<li>pLoF variants: These variants are those that disrupt the open reading frame of a gene, resulting in a truncated protein that is often non-functional. These variants include nonsense mutations, which introduce a premature stop codon into the coding sequence, and frameshift mutations, which insert or delete one or more nucleotides and alter the reading frame of the coding sequence. pLoF variants are rarer than missense or synonymous variants. They are more likely to be deleterious and result in a loss of gene function, resulting in a phenotype.</li>
<li>Missense variants: These variants are variations that result in a change of one amino acid in a protein, altering the structure and potentially the function of the protein. The functional effect of a missense variant can range from benign to pathogenic depending on the location and type of amino acid change. Missense variants are more common than pLoF variants, but less common than synonymous variants.</li>
<li>Synonymous variants: These variants are variations that do not change the amino acid sequence of a protein because the change in the nucleotide sequence still codes for the same amino acid. The effect of synonymous variants on the function of the protein is typically considered to be neutral, as the amino acid sequence is not altered. However, it's worth noting that it may have an effect on the stability, folding or translational efficiency of the protein. These variants are the most common among the three types of variants.</li>
</ol>
<div>It's worth noting that these are general characteristics, and each variant should be considered on a case by case basis, taking into account the specific context of the variant and the gene in which it occurs. Additionally, the effect of a variant can also be influenced by the presence of other genetic variants or by the environment.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div><br></div>
<div><h2>Beta value</h2></div>
<div><br></div>
<div>In the context of the Genebass webtool, beta values are coefficients that are used in the SKAT-O (Sequence Kernel Association Test for Rare and Common variants) statistical test to weigh the effect of each variant on the phenotype of interest. The SKAT-O test is a statistical method that is used to identify genetic variants that are associated with a specific phenotype by analyzing all variants within a gene or group of genes.</div>
<div>The beta values displayed on the Genebass webpage represent the estimated effect of each variant on the phenotype of interest. These values can be positive or negative, indicating that the variant has an increased or decreased effect on the phenotype, respectively.</div>
<div>In more detail, the beta value represents the log of the odds ratio (log(OR)) for each variant, in other words, the log of the ratio of the probability of a certain genotype to the probability of an alternate genotype. The magnitude of the beta value will depend on the effect size of the variant and the sample size of the study. Larger beta values correspond to a stronger association between a variant and the phenotype, and vice versa.</div>
<div>It is important to note that beta values are just one aspect of interpreting the results from a gene-based test, and other information such as p-values, variant frequencies and effect direction should also be considered when interpreting the results. Additionally, it's important to take into account the multiple testing correction to control for the false positive rate.</div>
