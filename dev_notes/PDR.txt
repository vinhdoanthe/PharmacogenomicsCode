<div>-My major concern: can not reach your adaptation</div>
<div> 	+You give me time to learn</div>
<div>	+You have your estimation for my learning time to adapt</div>
<div>	+I have Jimmy who are so good to help me</div>
<div>-My goal:</div>
<div>	+Short-term: Create a very useful DB —&gt serve a lot of people</div>
<div>	+Long-term: I really don’t know. I should worry about it but doing the best in the present is a wise choice. </div>
<div>	I would love to join courses —&gt to gradually know and create my own track</div>
<div>-My attitude:</div>
<div>	+For sure, I like this work and want to be success</div>
<div>-Could you help me my always remind me that I can not give up or I am about to give up? </div>
<div>-Suppose my only purpose here is to at least achieve what you are expecting</div>
<div>	+Should I work harder? —&gt sleep less/ cook less? —&gt sometimes not possible in long-term</div>
<div>        +How much time did you spend? At the period you feel you need to try very hard —&gt I might need an example</div>
<div>-What is a standard req for a postdoc? </div>
<div>-Did I lose my motivation? My friend stay up until 2am everyday!!!</div>
<div>-We might not count from June - 2022 - the level of expertise for developing the web is beyond video courses —&gt it should be from books, Django documentation</div>
